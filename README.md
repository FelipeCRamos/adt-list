# List Abstract Data Type

An C++ Abstract Data Type implementation (Double Linked List)

## Description

A double linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields, that are references to the previous node, next node and the data that the node holds.



## Compile

Since the main goal on this project isn't to create a main program, but instead, create a lib that can be used to create client's codes, we will teach first how to include the lib inside your project.

1. Download source code from this project, you can do it by cloning the git, downloading the zip, using wget...

2. Copy the source code (`list.hpp`) to your include folder inside your project.

3. Insert necessary `#include`'s on your needed files

4. Compile the program and be happy about it!

### Compile for this test

In order to test the driver code, you can type inside de root folder of the project:

```  bash
make
```

and execute-it by calling:

```bash
./adt-list
```
