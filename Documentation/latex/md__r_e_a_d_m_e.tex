An C++ Abstract Data Type implementation (Double Linked List)

\subsection*{Description}

A double linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields, that are references to the previous node, next node and the data that the node holds.

\subsection*{Compile}

Since the main goal on this project isn\textquotesingle{}t to create a main program, but instead, create a lib that can be used to create client\textquotesingle{}s codes, we will teach first how to include the lib inside your project.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download source code from this project, you can do it by cloning the git, downloading the zip, using wget...
\item Copy the source code ({\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{list_8hpp_source}{list.\+hpp}}}) to your include folder inside your project.
\item Insert necessary {\ttfamily \#include}\textquotesingle{}s on your needed files
\item Compile the program and be happy about it!
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Compile for this test}

In order to test the driver code, you can type inside de root folder of the project\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
make
\end{DoxyCode}


and execute-\/it by calling\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./adt-list
\end{DoxyCode}

All codes here we\textquotesingle{}re made by Felipe Ramos for the E\+DB I course on U\+F\+RN.
